Thank you so much [@Sandor](https://dribbble.com/sandor) for the icon, if you think this looks neat as hell like I do, you should commission some of him for some icon work! And thank you [@joeyabanks](https://twitter.com/joeyabanks) for helping me turn it into an app icon.

As I was building Boutique it became apparent to me that I needed a way to see the effects of changes I was making in a more real-world manner than using unit tests to measure performance changes. This performance profiler app helps measure those changes and allows me to see the outcome of any changes I make, and pinpoint performance hotspots. It also allows you the user, anyone who's interested in using Boutique, to see what kind of performance they can expect in their apps.

It also looks pretty dope, so I hope you find this app useful. The design is a twist on a terminal emulator, because when I think performance needs I think fun classic hardware.
