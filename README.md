### A simple but surprisingly fancy cache

Boutique is a simple but powerful caching library, a way to get offline storage in your apps with only a few lines of code using a very simple to understand API. Boutique is built atop [Bodega](https://github.com/mergesort/Bodega), with a reference implementation in this [repo](https://github.com/mergesort/fix-this) that builds an offline-ready app in only a few lines of code. You can read more about the philosophy in this blog post exploring an [MVC architecture for SwiftUI](https://fabisevi.ch/fix-this).
